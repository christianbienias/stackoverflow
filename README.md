## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

To use the jupyter notbook the standard python libraries pandas, matplotlib and seaborn are used.This ensures a comprehensive use of the notebook.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

As motivation of this project I would like to analyze current data from the year 2020 of the [Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) data  regarding the following business questions:

1. What are currently the most desired programming languages?
2. What are currently the most used programming languages?
3. Is there a coherence between satisfied & dissatisfied programming languages?
4. Is there a coherence between used and disered programming language?



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a notebook with the name 'exploration_template' in the folder, which analyzes the data from the year 2020 with respect to the defined business question. For the individual transformations, short explanations of the individual steps in the code are also given. Likewise, the subdivision into the respective business question is made with the result of the chart to be used to answer the question.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
